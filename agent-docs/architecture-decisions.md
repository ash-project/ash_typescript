# AshTypescript Architecture Changelog

Key architectural decisions and their reasoning for AI assistant context.

## 2025-09-16: Phoenix Channel RPC Actions

**Change**: Added Phoenix channel-based RPC action generation alongside HTTP-based functions
**Why**: Enable real-time applications to use the same type-safe RPC system over WebSocket connections
**Impact**: Optional feature that generates channel functions with identical pipeline integration and type safety
**Configuration**: `generate_phx_channel_rpc_actions: true` enables generation of functions with `Channel` suffix
**Key Files**: `lib/ash_typescript/rpc.ex` (config functions), `lib/ash_typescript/rpc/codegen.ex` (generation logic)
**Design Decision**: Additive approach - channel functions generated alongside, not instead of, HTTP functions for maximum flexibility

## 2025-08-19: Unified Schema Architecture

**Change**: Complete refactoring from multiple separate schemas to unified metadata-driven schema generation
**Why**: Previous system used separate schemas creating complex TypeScript inference and maintenance overhead
**Impact**: Single ResourceSchema per resource with `__type` metadata enables simpler, more predictable type inference
**Key Files**: `lib/ash_typescript/codegen.ex`, `lib/ash_typescript/rpc/codegen.ex`

## 2025-08-01: RPC Pipeline Complete Rewrite

**Change**: Complete rewrite from three-stage to four-stage architecture
**Why**: Performance issues, unclear separation of concerns, difficult debugging
**Impact**: 50%+ performance improvement, clean separation, fail-fast validation
**Pipeline Stages**: parse_request → execute_ash_action → process_result → format_output
**Key Files**: `lib/ash_typescript/rpc/pipeline.ex`, `lib/ash_typescript/rpc/requested_fields_processor.ex`

## 2025-08-01: Tidewave MCP Integration

**Change**: Enabled Tidewave MCP server for runtime introspection
**Why**: Traditional shell debugging was inefficient for exploring runtime behavior
**Impact**: Real-time Elixir evaluation, faster debugging, interactive development
**Tools**: Use `mcp__tidewave__project_eval` for runtime evaluation

## 2025-07-17: RPC Headers Support

**Change**: Added optional headers parameter to all RPC config types
**Why**: Hardcoded CSRF token functionality wasn't suitable for all authentication setups
**Impact**: All RPC functions accept custom headers while maintaining backward compatibility

## 2025-07-16: Union Storage Mode Unification

**Change**: Unified `:map_with_tag` and `:type_and_value` union storage modes
**Why**: `:map_with_tag` unions were failing creation due to complex field constraints
**Impact**: Both union storage modes work identically
**Insight**: Simple union definitions without complex constraints required for `:map_with_tag`

## 2025-07-15: Type Inference System Overhaul

**Change**: Implemented schema key-based field classification system
**Why**: System incorrectly assumed all complex calculations return resources
**Impact**: System correctly detects calculation return types, only adds `fields` when needed
**Insight**: Schema keys eliminate field type ambiguity through direct key lookup

## 2025-07-15: Unified Field Format

**Change**: Removed backwards compatibility for `calculations` parameter
**Why**: Dual processing paths added complexity
**Impact**: Single processing path with unified field format
**Insight**: Single source of truth for field specifications is more maintainable

## 2025-07-15: Embedded Resources Support

**Change**: Complete TypeScript support for embedded resources with relationship-like architecture
**Why**: Embedded resources needed full type safety and field selection capabilities
**Impact**: Embedded resources work exactly like relationships with unified object notation
**Insight**: Dual-nature processing (attributes + calculations) requires three-stage pipeline
